# FER
## How to run the code

First download the requirements.txt and the FER.py files. Then, create a folder in your computer where you will have a folder for the videos 
that you want to process, the FER.py and requirements.txt files. Then, open the terminal to create the virtual environment to install the libraries and run the code. You can
follow the steps below:
```
Python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Python FER.py
```
Before running the FER.py you need to change the input in:
folder_path = 'You need to change here for your folder name, where the videos are saved', for example folder_path = '.\Videos'.
